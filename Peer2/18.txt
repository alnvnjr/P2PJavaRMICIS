Hi!Thirty-eight years in, the Voyager software keeps on ticking. Suzy Dodd, the project manager for Voyager, says the software has been updated in flight, but NASA has never “shut it off or changed it completely.”

Because the probes have so little memory—the equivalent of about 70 kilobytes total—pieces of code were swapped in and out during different mission phases. This happened 18 times during the Jupiter flyby alone, the mission’s long-time project scientist, Ed Stone, told me in 2013. Once, in 2010, Voyager 2 began to send back garbled scientific data. Testing at the Jet Propulsion Lab, where Voyager was designed and is still managed, revealed that a single bit in a program had flipped from 0 to 1, according to Stone. The program was reloaded, and has worked since.

Its maximum lifespan, however, can be thought of as 48 years: 1977 to 2025. In 2013, Voyager 1 passed beyond the far reaches of the sun’s magnetic influence, putting it in the midst of particles that are more highly charged than the ones in our solar system. By 2020, mission scientists will have to shut down some remaining instruments, but the craft should continue to talk to earth until it pings home for the last time around 2025.
