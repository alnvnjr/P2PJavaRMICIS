The problemThis project has two purposes: first to makeyou familiarize with sockets/RPCs/RMIs, processes, threads; second to learn the design and internals of a peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing system.You  can  be  creative  with  this  project. You  are  free  to  use  any  programming  languages  (e.g.,  C/ C++ or Java) and any abstractions such as sockets, RPCs, RMIs, threads, events, etc. that might be needed. Also, you are free to use any machines such as your laptops or PCs.In this project, you need to design a simple P2P system that has two components:1.A central indexing server. This server indexes the contents of all of the peers that register with  it.  It  also  provides  search  facility to  peers.  In  our  simple  version,  you  don't  need  to implement sophisticated searching algorithms; an exact match will be fine. Minimally, the server should provide the following interface to the peer clients: oregistry(peer id, file name, ...)--invoked by a peer to register all its files with the indexing server. The server then builds the index for the peer. Other sophisticated algorithms such as automatic indexing are not required, but feel free to do whatever is reasonable. You may provide optional information to the server to make it more 'real', such as the clients’ bandwidth, etc. osearch(file  name)--this  procedureshould  search  the  index  and  return  all  the matching peers to the requestor. 2.A peer. A peer is both a client and a server. As a client, the user specifies a file name with the indexing server using "lookup". The indexing server returns a list of all otherpeers that hold the file. The user can pick one such peer and the client then connects to this peer and downloads the file. As a server, the peer waits for requests from other peers and sends the requested file  when  receiving  a  request.Minimally,  the  peer  server  should  provide  the following interface to the peer client: oretrieve(file name)--invoked by a peer to download a file from another peer. 
2Other requirements:•Both the indexing server and a peer server should be able to accept multipleclient requests at  the  same  time.  This  could  be  easily  done  using  threads.  Be  aware  of  the  thread synchronizing issues to avoid inconsistency or deadlock in your system. •No GUIs are required. Simple command line interfaces are fine. •Each  peershould  have  an  automatic  update  mechanism.If a  user  modifiesor  deletessome  files  registered ataserver,  the  effect  should  be  reflected  to the server  in  time.  For example, if a user deletes a file on thedisk, the server should be notified in time and also removethe corresponding itemfrom the index server. 2 Evaluation and MeasurementDeploy at least 3peers and 1 indexing server. They can be setup on the same machine (different directories) or different machines. Each peer has in its shared directory (all of which are indexed at the indexing server) at least 10 text files of varying sizes (for example 1k, 2k, ..., 10k). Make sure some files are replicated at more than one peer sites (so your query will give you multiple results to select). Do  a  simple  experiment  study  to  evaluate  the  behavior  of  your  system.  Compute  the  average response  time  per  client  search  request  by  measuring the  response  time  seen  by  a  client,  such  as 500 sequential requests. Also, measure the response times when multiple clients are concurrently making requests to the indexing server, for instance, you can vary the number of concurrent clients (N)  and  observe  how  the  average  response  time  changes,  make  necessary  plots  to  support  your conclusions.3 What you will submitWhen  you  have  finished  implementing the  complete  assignment  as described  above,  you  should submit your codeon blackboard. Each program must work correctly and be detailed in-line documented. You should hand in: 1.Output file: A copy of the output generated by running your program. When it downloads a  file,  have  your  program  print  a  message  "display  file  'foo'"  (don't  print  the  actual  file contents  if  they  are  large).  When  a  peer  issues  a  query  (lookup)  to  the  indexing  server,having your program print the returned results in a nicely formatted manner. 2.Design  Doc:  A  separate  (typed)  design  document  (named design.pdfor design.txt)of approximately  2-4    pages  describing  the  overall  program  design,  ,  and  design  tradeoffs considered  and  made.  Also  describe  possible  improvements  and  extensions  to  your program (and sketch how they might be made). 3.Source  code  and  program  list: All  of  the source  code  and  aprogram  listing  containing in-line documentation. 4.Manual: A  detailed  manual  describing  how  the  program  works.  The  manual  should  be able to instruct users other than the developer to run the program step by step. The manual should contain at least a test case which will generate the output matching the content of the output file you provided in 1.The manual mustinclude screenshots for each step.  5.Verification: A separate description (named test.pdfor test.txt) of the tests you ran on your program to convince yourself that it is indeed correct. Also describe any cases for which your program is known not to work correctly.
